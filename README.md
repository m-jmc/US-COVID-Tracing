## US COVID-19 Tracing

Beginning in late February early March I began working on two seperate COVID-19 projects. <br>
Here I've posted the United States county level analysis of COVID-19 growth trends and feature exploration. Both projects are best viewed on Kaggle, which allows use of the Knitr Tab function. I've included the county level analysis code and data files in this repo. Of course, this script depends on an updated dataset for each run. Updated data may be obtained [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset) curtesy of the New York Times.
